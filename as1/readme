tree structure
	|
	|----scripts:- It contains the scripting files to generate I/O requests. 
	|	      For generating I/O requests `dd` command has been used.
	|	|
	|	|---testing_[123].sh :- creates 80MB,40MB,20MB files(named as rfile_[123]) respectively.
	|	|	     These files are used for reading and copying data into another files(named wfile_[123]).
	|	|
	|	|---print_log.sh :- will print the latest log for inode to hit-count mapping.
	|
	|
	|----module:- Contains the module for generating page-cache hit counts per file.
	|	|
	|	|---dummy.c
	|	|---Makefile
	|
	|
	|----patchfile.patch:- Contain the patch.
	|
	|----understanding.txt:- explaining the control flow.
	|
	|----Experiment:- contains [read readme.txt]
				a)data for generating graph of page-cache hits for each file.
				b)Log from dmesg and output of scripts.
				c)readme.txt:- how experiment has been performed.
Note:-
	Since there can be many file(inode) to page-hit-count mappings after the unloading of module, graph is ploted only for the files used for reading and writting e.i. rfile_1,rfile_2,rfile_3,wfile_1,wfile_2 and wfile_3.



2)	How to patch:-

	1)extract files from tarball of 3.18.1
		tar xf ./linux-3.18.1.tar.xz
	2)change directory
		cd linux-3.18.1
	3)applying patch:-
		patch -p1 < [path for patchfile.patch]
